setCaptive 
Behavior: local 
Game: Operation Flashpoint (1.00) 
Description: Mark a unit as captive. 
If unit is a vehicle, commander is marked. 
A captive is neutral to everyone, and will not trigger "detected 
 by" conditions for its original side. 
Using a number (instead of a boolean) for the status has no further 
 effect on the engine's behavior, but can be used by captiveNum to keep 
 track of the captivity status at a finer resolution (e.g. handcuffed 
, grouped, etc.) 
The numbered status syntax was introduced in Arma 2.  
Syntax:  
 unitName setCaptive status 
Parameters: 
unitName: Object 
status: Boolean or Number - When using a number parameter, any value&gt;0 is considered to be the same as true 
Return Value: 
 Nothing
