getPlayerUID 
Game: ARMA 2  (1.02) 
Description: Return an uniqueID of the given unit as string if it's player and empty 
 value if it's AI. The uniqueID may be up to 100 characters long 
 and may contain numbers, uppercase letters and underscores (the value 
 can be used to construct a valid variable name by appending to another 
 valid variable name). 
Note: while for ArmA 2 or ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead until version 
 1.60 the result always contains a number, it should be always handled 
 as an opaque string. Converting it to a Number can cause precision 
 problems, as Number cannot accurately represent integers above 16777216 
 (2^24). Moreover, game versions since ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead 
 1.61 provide a non-numeric value as a result.
