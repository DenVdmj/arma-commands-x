.  
 Variables _id and _name are set, in theory _id being the session 
 id number as seen in #userlist.  
Note that as of 1.08, this command only accepts a code-string rather 
 than code delimited by braces. 
Note as of ArmA 2 version 1.02 this function returns also variable 
 _uid with uniqueID of player. 
As of version Arma2 1.04, _id will return a number in float format 
, something like 1.4253e+10.  
_id is the Unique DirectPlay ID of player, and there are some conversions 
 between DirectPlay floats and Arma Engine numbers.
