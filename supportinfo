 has the format: "x:name" Where x can be:'t' - type'n' - null operator 
'u' - unary operator'b' - binary operator. 
'name' is the operator or type name (in case operator, type of input 
 operands is included). mask parameter can be an empty string, or one of field 
. In this case, function returns empty array, if operator is not included 
 in the list. Limited wildcard support is available. Type x may be replaced 
 with *, meaning all types. For the mask partial match may be used 
, like abc*, meaning any operators starting with 'abc' are reported 
, for example: *:name, t:*, t:name* or *:*.
