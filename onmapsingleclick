onMapSingleClick 
Game: Operation Flashpoint: Resistance (1.85) 
Description: Define action performed when user clicks in map by executing command 
 string. 
the string receives 3 (localised in scope) variables: _pos: Array 
 - Clicked position _units: Array - Units which were selected (via function 
 keys) before opening the map (may be non-functional in Arma) _shift 
, _alt Boolean - Whether &lt;Shift&gt; or &lt;Alt&gt; were pressed 
 when clicking on the map 
When click is processed, code should ultimately return true back 
 to the engine. If false is returned, default processing by the game 
 engine is done. Return value of any other type (including Nothing 
) is an error. In such case default processing by the game engine 
 is done, and error message may be displayed. 
The code is executed on every click, until the Command is removed 
 via onMapSingleClick "", orreplaced by onMapSingleClick "SomeOtherCommand 
(s)"
