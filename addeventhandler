addEventHandler 
Behavior: global, local 
Game: Operation Flashpoint: Resistance (1.85) 
Description: Adds an event handler to a given unit. For more information about 
 event handlers and their types check the scripting topic Event handlers 
 in this reference. You may add as many event handlers of any type 
 as you like to every unit, if you add an event handler of type "killed 
" and there already exists one, the old one doesn't get overwritten 
. Use removeEventHandler to delete event handlers.  
Every event will create an array named _this, which contains specific 
 information about the particular event. (e.g. the "killed" EH will 
 return an array with 2 elements: the killed unit, and the killer 
.)

 Number = object addEventHandler [type, command]

type: String - Event Handler type 
command: Code or String - code that should be executed once the event occurs 
Return Value: 
 Number -  The index of the currently added event handler is returned. Indices start at 0 for each unit and increment with each added event handler. (optional)
