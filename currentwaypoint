currentWaypoint 
Game: ARMA 2  (1.00) 
Description: Return the index of the current waypoint. 
To determine the validity of the index, compare it to the waypoints 
 count. 
If all waypoints are 'completed', then the index is 1 greater than 
 the last valid index. 
If there are no waypoints, then the index is 0. 
By default, a group has 1 waypoint at their starting position, which 
 is considered completed and so the currentWaypoint is 1.
