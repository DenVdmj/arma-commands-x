Game: Armed Assault (1.00) 
Description: Delete a collection. As example, used with a soldier, it'll hide 
 the ingame model. 
When targetting ArmA 2 1.06 or newer, use hideObject instead. This 
 function is a relic from dynamic building destruction development 
. It is left only for compatibility with scripts created before ArmA 
 2 1.06, and its functionality may be changed or removed in the future 
.
