Game: Operation Flashpoint (1.27) 
Description: Selects the given weapon. 
Note: For weapons that have more than one muzzle, you have to input 
 the muzzlename and not the weaponName. 
The only weapons that have muzzleNames seem to be rifles with grenade 
 launchers, handgrenades, smokeshells and satchels. 
In all other cases the weaponName must be used.Fortunately, in OFP, in most 
 cases, both names are the same. But check. 
In ArmA the weaponNames and muzzleNames are different. 
For muzzle names see cfgWeapons.
