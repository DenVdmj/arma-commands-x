uiSleep 
Game: ARMA 2  (1.05) 
Description: Suspend execution of script for given uitime.  uiSleep is a sleep 
 method to delay script execution where script time/simulation time 
 is stopped. uiSleep is basically using the system time (uiTime more 
 specifically) and not simulation time. So in the cases where sleep 
 command would get stuck indefinitely, uiSleep can still be used 
 to effectively delay script execution. For example in a mission 
 briefing or an editor or when simulation is paused in general.
