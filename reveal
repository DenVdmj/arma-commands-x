reveal 
Game: Operation Flashpoint (1.00) 
Description: Reveals a unit to a group or another unit.  
The knowledge value will be set to the highest level any unit of the revealing 
 side has about the revealed unit. If the revealing side has no knowledge 
 about the revealed unit, the value will be set to 1. 
Since ARMA 2 OA 1.60 the alternative syntax is available. Values 
 greater than or equal 1.5 reveal the side of the unit, too. 
The knowledge level can only be increased, not decreased by this 
 command.
