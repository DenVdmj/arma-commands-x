createCenter 
Game: Armed Assault (1.00) 
Description: Creates a new AI HQ for the given side. An 'HQ ' is something each 
 side needs to have to be able to communicate. By default, all centers 
 for units which are present in the mission are created before the mission 
 is started. This command can be used to initialize a side which 
 has no units present in the Mission.sqm, so that you can spawn groups 
 and units for it. 
For the available sides see Side.
