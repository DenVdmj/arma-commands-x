vehicleChat 
Game: Operation Flashpoint (1.34) 
Description: Type text to vehicle radio channel. 
This function only types text to the list, it does not broadcast 
 the message. If you want the message to show on all computers, you have 
 to execute it on them. 
Object parameter must be a vehicle, not a player. 
If you are in a crew seat (i.e. driver, gunner or commander), then 
 it will include that role in the chat name output (Eg: Driver (you_name 
): "Message").
