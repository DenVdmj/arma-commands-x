preprocessFile 
Game: Operation Flashpoint: Resistance (1.85) 
Description: Reads and processes the content of the specified file. Preprocessor 
 is C-like, supports comments using // or /* and */ and macros defined 
 with #define. 
Due to the hard-drive access this command executes (and the lack 
 of caching) this command should not be used in time-critical script 
 loops.  
Syntax:  
 String = preprocessFile fileName 
Parameters: 
fileName: String 
Return Value: 
 String
