exitWith 
Game: Armed Assault (1.00) 
Description: If the result of condition is true, code is evaluated, and current 
 block with result of code. It only exits the current scope. 
exitWith exits the execution of a loop defined by one of commands 
 do, for, count or forEach. When you use exitWith not inside a loops 
, the behaviour is undefined - sometimes it may exit the script, sometimes 
 some other scope, but this is not intended and designed behaviour 
 of this command, and it is not guaranteed to work reliably. 
It exits the loop only, not the script.  
Syntax:  
 if (condition) exitWith {Code}
