list 
Behavior: global 
Game: Operation Flashpoint (1.00) 
Description: List of units that would activate given Trigger. 
It returns nothing before the simulation strted, i.e. in (undelayed 
) init.sqf files or in VBS OME. Returns a pointer to the trigger 
's list after the simulation started. 
Since this is just a reference this means that the value in your 
 local variable will change as the content of the trigger area changes 
. To permanently copy the returned list to a different variable, use _mylist 
 = +(list triggerOne). 
The second example can be used inside the trigger (in that case, no need 
 to name your trigger). 
For trigger of type "Not present" the list is the same as that returned 
 for "present".  
Syntax:  
Array =  list trigger 
Parameters:
