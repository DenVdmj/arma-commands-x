setTerrainGrid 
Game: Operation Flashpoint: Resistance (1.75) 
Description: Operation Flashpoint, VBS1: Set desired terrain resolution (in meters 
). For default landscapes, supported resolutions are: 50 - smoothest 
, less lag 25 - default in multiplayer 12.5 - default in singleplayer 
 6.25 3.125 - bumpiest, higher lag 
If you select unsupported resolutions, nearest supported value is used 
 instead.  
Armed Assault, VBS2: Terrain resolution is fixed, determined by the world 
 created. This function controls terrain LOD instead (the distance 
 in which the terrain mesh resolution starts to degrade). Higher 
 number means less vertices are used for terrain rendering, making 
 distant hills less smooth. Value 12.5 corresponds to selecting Terrain 
 Detail Normal in Video options, 50 to Very Low, 3.125 to Very High 
.
