saveProfileNamespace 
Game: Take On Helicopters (1.00) 
Description: Saves the variables stored in profileNamespace to the persistent 
 active user profile.  Warning: this is a file operation, which makes 
 it expensive! It is not recommended to do this at a high frequency 
 in a loop for example. It is however also recommended not to change 
 a large amount of variables and wait long before saving, because 
 certain game crashes may cause a loss of data.  Warning: saving 
 a lot of data can quickly increase the size of the profile variables 
 file, so keep an eye on this. Warning: TKOH's Heliport status (used 
 in the Career mode for example) is stored in this file, so be mindful 
 of working with this technology to avoid losing data and progress 
.
