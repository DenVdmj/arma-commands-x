isNull 
Behavior: global 
Game: Operation Flashpoint (1.00) 
Description: Checks whether the tested item is Null. 
Which null type the item has to be equal to depends on the type of object 
 tested: 
 Objects -&gt; objNull Controls -&gt; controlNull Displays -&gt; displayNull 
 Groups -&gt; grpNull Locations -&gt; locationNull (since ARMA 2) Tasks 
 -&gt; taskNull (since ARMA 2) Team Members -&gt; teamMemberNull 
 (since ARMA 2) 
Note: A test via == does not work, because, for example, objNull 
 is not equal to anything, not even to itself.  
Syntax:  
 isNull obj 
Parameters: 
obj: Object, Control, Display, Group (or Location, Task, Team Member, since ARMA 2) 
Return Value: 
 Boolean
