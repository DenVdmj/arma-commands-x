setEditorObjectScope 
Game: ARMA 2  (1.00) 
Description: This command defines the level of access a user has to editor objects 
. 
"objects" is an array of either Editor Objects (eg ["_unit_0"]) or actual 
 Game Objects (eg [player]). If the array is empty then the command 
 will automatically parse all editor objects. 
"editorType" is the editor type to effect (eg "unit", "vehicle", "center 
") or "" for all types. 
"condition" is an executable string that must evaluate to true or false 
. If true, the scope of the evaluated editor object will be modified 
. "_x" can be used in the string as reference to the ingame representation 
 of the currently processed array member. 
"scope" is one of "HIDE", "VIEW", "SELECT", "LINKTO", "LINKFROM", "ALLNODRAG 
", "ALLNOTREE", "ALLNOCOPY", "ALLNOSELECT" or "ALL". 
"subordinatesAlso" is a boolean value. If true then subordinates 
 in the editor will be assigned the same scope as the parent.
