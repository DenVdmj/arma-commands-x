setVehicleVarName 
Behavior: global 
Game: Armed Assault (1.00) 
Description: Sets the name of the variable which contains a reference to this 
 object. It is necessary in MP to change the variable content after 
 a respawn. When you only use 'myVar = &lt;vehicle&gt;', you'll just 
 have a normal variable, when you use this command as well, 'myVar 
' will be the name for the vehicle, i.e. if you have other variables 
 containing the vehicle, they'll now return 'myVar' and not WEST 
... 
Note: This command does not set 'myVar' to contain the vehicle, this 
 has to be done separately.
